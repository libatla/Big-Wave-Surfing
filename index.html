		<p><span style="color:red;">Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which experienced</span> 
		surfers paddle into, or are towed into, waves which are at least 20 feet (6.2 m)
		high, on surf boards known as "guns" or towboards.<br>[1] Sizes of the board needed to 
		successfully surf these waves vary by the size of the wave as well as the technique
		the surfer uses to reach the wave.<br> A larger, longer board allows a rider to paddle fast
		enough to catch the wave and has the advantage of being more stable, but it also limits 
		maneuverability and surfing speed.

		<hr>
		<p><div id="specialstyle">In 1992, big wave surfers such as Buzzy Kerbox, Laird Hamilton and Darrick Doerner
		introduced a cross over sport called tow-in surfing.</div>[4] While many riders still participate
		in both sports, they remain very distinct activities.<br> This type of surfing involves being towed 
		into massive waves by jet ski, allowing for the speed needed to successfully ride.<br> Tow-in surfing
		also revolutionized board size, allowing surfers to trade in their unwieldy 12 ft.<br> boards in favor
		of light, 7 ft boards that allowed for more speed and easier maneuvrability in waves over 30 ft (10 meters).<br>
		By the end of the 1990s, tow in surfing allowed surfers to ride waves exceeding 50 ft (15 meters).
